Version 1.1.0
Migration Steps:
(Local Dev Environment Only): make sure you create a local.build.properties files as per example in build.xml.
Make sure this file is ignored so it's never checked into SVN.

1. For each environment, a CAPTCHA username and password must be obtained from Portal Support or Michael Bacarella.
   When requesting the username and password, provide the Environment name (ex. TST), the Application Name (CCRB Complaint Status),
   and the application URL (ex. http://nyc-tst-web.csc.nycnet/apps/ccrb-status-lookup).
2. In /ccrb-status-lookup/setup/ open the appropriate properties file for the environment being deployed to.
   Ensure that the ccrbsl.captachausername property value is set to the CAPTCHA username provided Portal Support (ex. CCRB Complaint Status).
   Replace the ccrbsl.captchapassword property value with the CAPTCHA password provided by Portal Support.
   If the password contains a backslash character (\) you must escape the character by placing another backslash in front of it (\\)
3. Copy the modified properties file to /ccrb-status-lookup/src/main/resources/gov/nyc/doitt/ccrb/statuslookup/ccrbsl.properties
